// Rules of defining variable:
/*
 1.  variable start with alphabate  and underscore
 2. can't start with digits
 3. it can have alphabate, underscore, digits
 4. variable shouldn't have whitespaces 
 5. before declare a variable it should have a data type in front of variable name and it should be initalized before we use it.

// types of variable

/*
  local variable :
   A variable that is declared and used inside the function or block is called local variable. 
   Itâ€™s scope is limited to function or block. It cannot be used outside the block.Local variables need 
   to be  initialized before use.
 
*/

int function1()
{
    int x = 10; // local variable for function1;
                /*
    here we use this x variable only in function1 because it is a local variable. we can't use x outside of this function. if we try then it gives us an error.
    this is how local variable works
    */
    printf("%d\n", x);
}

int main()
{
    function1();
    return 0;
}

// global variable
/*
A variable that is declared outside the function or block is called a global variable. 
It is declared at the starting of program. It is available to all the functions. 
*/
int x = 10; // global variable for function1;

int function1()
{

    printf("from function1 ðŸ‘‰ %d\n", x);
}
int function2()
{

    printf("from function1 ðŸ‘‰ %d\n", x);
}

int main()
{
    function1();
    function2();
    printf("from main ðŸ‘‰ %d\n", x);

    // we can use x any where in this file. that's why it is called global variable
    return 0;
}

// static  variable

/*
A variable that retains its value between multiple function calls is known as static variable. 
It is declared with the static keyword. 
*/

int function1()
{
    static int x = 10;
    x = x + 10;

    printf("%d\n", x);
}

int main()
{
    function1();
    function1();
    function1();
    //  static variable will print the incremented value in each function call. that means static variable will change after call this function and assigned new increment value
    return 0;
}



// 4. Autometic variables
/*
Which variables declared inside the block, are automatic variables by default. We 
can explicitly declare an automatic variable using auto keyword.
NB: Automatic variables are similar as 
local variables.
so i don't give this type  of variable's example;
we move on;

*/

/* 5. External variable can be shared between multiple C files.We can declare external variable using extern keyword.
like you have  single.c and double.c files. if you declared a variable in single.c as 
extern int x=10; 
you can use this variable to double.h file also single.h file.

it is a kind of a vast version of global variable.
