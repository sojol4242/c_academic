<h3>Basic Syntax and concepts of C programme</h3>
👇
<hr/>
 
 
```
 #include <stdio.h> 👉 This is header files. here we found the build in files in C

int main() <--Every C programme has a Main function. By this function our code or programme will be run-->

{

# Start Main function body where our code executes

// single line comment in C

# multiline comment in c
👇
/*

void function()
{
int x = 20; //local variable
static int y = 30; //static variable
auto z = 4;
x = x + 10;
y = y + x;
printf("\n%d,%d, %f", x, y);

}
*/

    printf("Hello C Programme\n Welcome to Dept of EEE");

    return 0; // we should put a semicolon (;) after every statement

}

// user defined function func1(), func2(), func3()
👇
int func1()
{
// code here
}
int func2()
{
// code here
}
int func3()
{
// code here
}

<h3>Variables and Keywords</h3>
<hr/>
<p>Today I talked about variables and keywords in C programming.<p/>
<p>Let's Start<p/>
<p>You can find all the code  on <a href="https://github.com/sojol4242/c_academic/tree/sojol/variable%20and%20keyword"> Here⏩ <a/><p/>


What is variable?

```
A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
