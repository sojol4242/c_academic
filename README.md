<h3>Basic Syntax and concepts of C programme</h3>
üëá
<hr/>
 
 
```
 #include <stdio.h> üëâ This is header files. here we found the build in files in C

int main() <--Every C programme has a Main function. By this function our code or programme will be run-->

{

# Start Main function body where our code executes

// single line comment in C

# multiline comment in c

üëá
/\*

void function()
{
int x = 20; //local variable
static int y = 30; //static variable
auto z = 4;
x = x + 10;
y = y + x;
printf("\n%d,%d, %f", x, y);

}
\*/

    printf("Hello C Programme\n Welcome to Dept of EEE");

    return 0; // we should put a semicolon (;) after every statement

}

// user defined function func1(), func2(), func3()
üëá
int func1()
{
// code here
}
int func2()
{
// code here
}
int func3()
{
// code here
}

<h3>Variables and Keywords</h3>
<hr/>

What is variable?

```

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.

<h3>Operator</h3>
<hr/>

# What is Operator?

```

Operators are the foundation of any programming language. Thus the functionality of C/C++ programming language is incomplete without the use of operators. We can define operators as symbols that help us to perform specific mathematical and logical computations on operands. In other words, we can say that an operator operates the operands.

# Types of operators
A few types of operators available in C language eventually all are exists in other languages so.
```

1. Arithmetic Operators.
